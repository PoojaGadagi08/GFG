Given a character array tasks of size N, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. 
  Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.
CPU has a cooldown period for each task. CPU can repeat a task only after atleast K units of time has passed after it did same task last time. It can perform other tasks in 
  that time, can stay idle to wait for repeating that task.

Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
K = 2
task[ ] = {'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B'}
Output: 8
Explanation: 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is atleast 2 units of time between any two same tasks.
 
Example 2:

Input:
N = 12
K = 2
task[ ] = {'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}
Output: 16
Explanation:  
One possible solution is 
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A.

        for (char task : tasks) {
            freq[task - 'A']++;
        }
        // Sort the frequency array in non-decreasing order
        Arrays.sort(freq);
        // Calculate the maximum frequency of any task
        int maxFreq = freq[25] - 1;
        // Calculate the number of idle slots that will be required
        int idleSlots = maxFreq * K;
        // Iterate over the frequency array from the second highest frequency to the lowest frequency
        for (int i = 24; i >= 0 && freq[i] > 0; i--) {
            // Subtract the minimum of the maximum frequency and the current frequency from the idle slots
            idleSlots -= Math.min(maxFreq, freq[i]);
        }
        // If there are any idle slots left, add them to the total number of tasks
        return idleSlots > 0 ? idleSlots + tasks.length : tasks.length;
    }
}
