Given a positive integer n, find the nth fibonacci number. Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo 1000000007.

Example 1:

Input: 
n = 2
Output: 
1 
Explanation: 
1 is the 2nd number of fibonacci series.
Example 2:

Input: 
n = 5
Output: 
5
Explanation: 
5 is the 5th number of fibonacci series.
Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function nthFibonacci() which takes n as input parameter and returns nth fibonacci number.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1<= n <=105

class Solution {
    static int nthFibonacci(int n){
        // code here
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }
        
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[] fib = new int[n + 1];
        fib[0] = 0;
        fib[1] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            fib[i] = (fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return fib[n];
    }
}
