Q.There are N rooms in a straight line in Geekland State University's hostel,
you are given a binary string S of length N where S[i] = '1' represents that there is a wifi in ith room or S[i] = '0' represents no wifi.
Each wifi has range X i.e. if there is a wifi in ith room then its range will go upto X more rooms on its left as well as right. 
You have to find whether students in all rooms can use wifi.


class Solution 
{ 
   boolean wifiRange(int N, String S, int X){
        int freq[]=new int[N+1];
        for(int i=0;i<N;i++)
        {
            if(S.charAt(i)=='1')
            {
                // there is wifi from i-X to i+X
                int left=Math.max(i-X,0);
                int right=Math.min(i+X,N-1);
                freq[left]++;
                freq[right+1]--;
            }
        }
        for(int i=0;i<N;i++)
        {
            if(i>0) freq[i]+=freq[i-1];
            if(freq[i]==0) // no access to wifi here
                return false;
        }
        return true;
   }
}
