Given two strings s and t of length n and m respectively. Find the count of distinct occurrences of t in s as a sub-sequence modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:

Input:
s = "banana" , t = "ban"
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
There are 3 sub-sequences:[ban], [ba n], [b an].
Example 2:

Input:
s = "geeksforgeeks" , t = "ge"
Output: 
6
Explanation: 
There are 6 sub-sequences:[ge], [ge], [g e], [g e] [g e] and [g e].
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function subsequenceCount() which takes two strings as argument s and t and returns the count of the sub-sequences modulo 109 + 7.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n*m).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n*m).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n,m ≤ 1000



  class Solution
{
        static int prime = (int) (Math.pow(10, 9) + 7);

    int  subsequenceCount(String s1, String s2)
    {
	// Your code here
	int n =s1.length();
	int m =s2.length();
	 int dp[][] = new int[n + 1][m + 1];

        // Initialize the first column with 1 because there's one empty subsequence in any string.
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }

        // Initialize the first row (except dp[0][0]) with 0 because there's no way to form s2 from an empty string.
        for (int i = 1; i < m + 1; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = 0;
        }

        // Fill the dp array using a bottom-up approach
        for (int i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m + 1; j++) {
                if (s1.charAt(i - 1) == s2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    // If the characters match, we can either include this character in the subsequence
                    // or exclude it. So, we add the counts from both possibilities.
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j]) % prime;
                } else {
                    // If the characters don't match, we can only exclude this character.
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][m];
    }
}
