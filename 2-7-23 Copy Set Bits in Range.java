Given two numbers X and Y, and a range [L, R] where 1 <= L <= R <= 31. You have to copy the set bits of 'Y' in the range L to R in 'X'. Return this modified X.

Note: Range count will be from Right to Left & start from 1.

Example 1:

Input: 
X = 44, Y = 3 
L = 1,  R = 5
Output: 
47
Explaination: 
Binary represenation of 44 and 3 is 101100 and 000011. So in the range 1 to 5 there are two set bits of 3 (1st & 2nd position). If those are set in 44 it will become 101111 which is 47.
Example 2:

Input: 
X = 16, Y = 2
L = 1,  R = 3
Output: 18
Explaination: Binary represenation of 16 and 2 is 10000 and 10. If the mentioned conditions are applied then 16 will become 10010 which is 18.

    static int setSetBit(int x, int y, int l, int r){
        // code here
          for(int i=l;i<=r;i++)
        {
            if((y&(1<<(i-1)))!=0)
                x=x|(1<<(i-1));
        }
        
            return x;
    }
}
