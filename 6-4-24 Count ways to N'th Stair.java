There are n stairs, and a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does not matter).

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
Output: 
3
Explanation: 
You can reach 4th stair in 3 ways.
3 possible ways are:
1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
Here, note that {1, 1, 2}, {1, 2, 1} and {2, 1, 1} are considered same as their order does not matter. 
Example 2:

Input:
n = 5
Output: 
3
Explanation:
You may reach the 5th stair in 3 ways.
The 3 possible ways are:
1, 1, 1, 1, 1
1, 1, 1, 2
1, 2, 2
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function countWays() which takes a single argument n and returns the answer.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106




  class Solution
{
    //Function to count number of ways to reach the nth stair 
    //when order does not matter.
    Long countWays(int m)
    {
        // your code here
        long dp[]=new long [m+2];
        dp[0]=0;
        dp[1]=1;
        int k=2;
        for(int i=2;i<=m;i+=2){
            dp[i]=k;
            dp[i+1]=k;
            k++;
        }
        return dp[m];
    }
